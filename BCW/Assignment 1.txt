**1.3 Getting to Know You**  

I opted for this course because I had to choose between *Business Communication Workshop* and *French*. Frankly, French was not an option for me, and I believe this course could be valuable for my future plans, especially as I aim to launch an online refurbished laptop business.  

**Career Goals**  
I am deeply passionate about embedded systems and computer engineering. My long-term goal is to work at leading technology companies such as CGATE, Intel, or IBM, contributing to cutting-edge innovations.  

**Employment & Favorite Activities**  
I have practical experience managing a small digital business. Starting with zero guidance, I initially invested 40K, faced losses, but eventually recovered my investment along with a small profit of 600 after several months. With further learning and larger investments, I managed to grow my earnings significantly. This experience enhanced my problem-solving and decision-making skills. In my free time, I enjoy working on embedded systems projects, robotics, and hands-on hardware experimentation.  

**Communication Skills**  
I consider my verbal communication skills strong, particularly due to my business experience, where I had to independently engage and persuade customers. My writing skills, however, need improvement — although with the help of tools like AI, I am actively addressing this weakness.  



**Body Language: My Take**

a. **Wringing hands, tugging ears:**  
These usually show nervousness or anxiety. Sometimes it’s just a habit, so context is key.

b. **Bowed posture, twiddling thumbs:**  
A bowed posture might be a sign of respect or fatigue, while twiddling thumbs typically hints at nervousness or impatience. The setting really matters.

c. **Steepled hands, sprawling sitting:**  
I see steepled hands as a mark of confidence and thoughtful consideration, whereas a sprawling posture often means being relaxed or even dominant—but it can seem too casual in a formal situation.

d. **Rubbing hand through hair:**  
This often points to self-consciousness or stress, although in laid-back scenarios it might simply be a comfort gesture.

e. **Open hands, unbuttoned coat:**  
Open hands usually signal honesty and openness. An unbuttoned coat gives off a relaxed vibe but might not fit in a formal setting.

In short, while these gestures give clues about someone’s mood or attitude, their true meaning always depends on the context and the individual.



**Silent Messages: My Self-Analysis**

I realize I constantly send silent messages through my appearance, body language, and behavior. Here’s how I group and interpret them for different audiences:

- **Appearance:**  
  • For my employer, I choose formal attire and neat grooming to signal professionalism.  
  • In class, I dress appropriately to show respect for my instructor and the learning environment.  
  • With classmates, a more relaxed style makes me appear approachable.

- **Body Language:**  
  • In lectures, I maintain eye contact, nod, and sit up straight, indicating engagement and respect.  
  • With peers, a relaxed posture and open gestures convey friendliness.  
  • At work, confident yet measured body language reflects competence and attentiveness.

- **Behavior:**  
  • Punctuality and active participation in class send the message that I value the learning process.  
  • Responsiveness and reliability at work demonstrate my commitment and professionalism.

In short, while these silent cues might mean different things in various settings, being aware of them helps me tailor my communication to meet the expectations of my instructors, classmates, and employer.




Subject: Self-Expression in the Workplace – My Thoughts

Dear Professor,

I’d like to share my perspective on tattoos as a form of self-expression at work. From my observations and class discussions, it’s clear that tattoos and piercings send powerful, nonverbal messages. Many of us see them as symbols of creativity, individuality, and sometimes even rebellion. However, their interpretation really depends on the industry. In technology or retail, for instance, these forms of expression are more readily accepted, whereas in fields like banking or law, they might be viewed as unprofessional.

When I compare tattoos to other forms of self-expression—like wearing casual clothes or blogging and tweeting about one’s employer—I notice a few similarities and differences. Both tattoos and casual attire express personal style and identity. Yet, tattoos are permanent markers of who we are, while clothing and social media posts can be adjusted to suit different environments. All these expressions influence how we are perceived by our peers, employers, and customers, and they can either strengthen or weaken our professional image depending on the context.

Overall, I believe it’s important to balance self-expression with professionalism. Being aware of the silent messages we send helps us make better choices that align with our career goals and the expectations of our workplace.

Thank you for considering my thoughts on this topic.

Sincerely,  
[Your Name]
